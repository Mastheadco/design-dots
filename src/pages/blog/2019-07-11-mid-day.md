Sometimes I find that I don't have enough "unique" dots to share until the day is nearly halfway done. Today is one of those days. Plenty of links being shared around the usual spots, but I try to make it a point to not share the exact same thing the other sites are sharing. Sometimes I find that I get ready to publish a post of dots and the other sites have the same links, so I have to go back and replace them. Other times I feel that they need to be shared regardless of the duplication on other design news sites. Part of the job, I guess.
